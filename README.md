# ExplorerFrame
**Experimental project. Not for production use.**

ExplorerFrame is a program that resolves some improper behaviors caused by File Explorer regarding extending DWM frames into its client area.

## Limitations
- ExplorerFrame only works in Dark mode. Light mode will cause the text to render improperly.
- ExplorerFrame doesn't resolve the gray backgrounds of some UI elements (like scrollbars).

## How does it work?
It works by hooking into Explorer and detouring Windows' `DwmExtendFrameIntoClientArea` with a custom implementation that ignores calls from File Explorer.

## Are the changes reversible?
Yes. The changes only persist in memory, meaning that if you close ExplorerFrame and restarts Explorer, all changes are undone.
